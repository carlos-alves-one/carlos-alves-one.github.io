        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>How did you approach the subject? What does your site say about future you?</p>
        <p>This project was with great interest because it was something that I had already thought of developing as a support for a future job application. There are countless reasons to have an online portfolio. But without a doubt, the main thing is to be able to complement the curriculum in a more detailed and more interactive way. The future employer can have a more detailed view of candidate skills and experience.</p>
        <p>After I had created and developed my website, where I present myself as a software engineer, I can say that it will be my primary motivation and immediate objective after finishing my master's degree. Besides, over the next few years, I will update all projects to enrich my portfolio.</p>

        <p>Who is your audience?</p>
        <p>My audience is all companies in the technological market, namely in the creation and development of software. The area I intend to reach will be more precisely companies that develop machine learning solutions. It could be companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, IBM, etc.</p>

          <li>Accessibility aspect 1</li>
            <ul> 
                <li>The website must be perceivable</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
          <li>Accessibility aspect 3</li>
            <ul> 
                <li>The website must be understandable</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>How have you made the site easy to navigate?</p>
        <p>Navigation on my website will at the bottom of the page. So that navigation is carried out a direct and straightforward way. All the pages' content will be present in a simplified and summarized form, with connection to other pages to present more or complement previously presented content. The entire layout designed so that a person with poor eyesight can access the content easily. The colours were selected so as not to disturb the correct visualization of the pages and their content. Finally, another decision made to eliminate any photo or image so as not to conflict with copyright.</p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <h3>Learning</h3>
          <p>The website development would never be possible before there were first learning and practice of the general knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And without a doubt, the lectures presented complemented with other information, namely online and reading books related to the subject, were undoubtedly fundamental so that it was possible to present my website as the final result of all the acquired learning.</p>
        <h3>Libraries and other resources</h3>
          <p>In this project, I did not use any library, for the fact to present in more detail all the implemented code and to be able to control better the final result, namely the use of CSS. I will undoubtedly implement the use of libraries to present better design and functionality.</p>

        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>What worked well</h3>
            <p>I can say that the final result of the site was what I expected to be. It was not an easy process, but the final result, in my opinion I think was very positive. I liked the part where I developed and integrated the numbers game with the rest of the site. The implementation of this game and the rest of the code allowed me to present my knowledge of JavaScript acquired in the last term with HTML and CSS.</p>

            <p>Undoubtedly can improve the use and implementation of libraries and a better responsive website.</p>
